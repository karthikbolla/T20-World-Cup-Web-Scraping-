# T20 World Cup Web Scraping Project
This is a web scraping project that I developed to extract data from the T20 World Cup website using the Beautiful Soup package in Python. The goal of the project was to collect data on the teams, players, and match schedules for the T20 World Cup and store it in a structured format for analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview:
* Web scraping using Beautiful Soup package in Python
* Data extraction from T20 World Cup website (https://www.t20worldcup.com)
* Collection of data on match schedules
* Storage of data in a structured format (e.g. CSV file)

## Getting Started:
To use this project, you will need to have Python and the Beautiful Soup package installed on your computer. You can install Beautiful Soup using the following command:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
* Once you have Beautiful Soup installed, you can run the web_scraping.py file to extract the data from the T20 World Cup website. The extracted data will be saved in a CSV file named t20 worldcup.csv in the data folder.

## Project Structure:
The project is organized into the following files and folders:
* T20_worldcup.ipynb: the main Python script that contains the web scraping code
* data: a folder that contains the t20 worldcup.csv file with the extracted data
* README.md: this file

## Contents of t20 worldcup.csv:
The t20 worldcup.csv file contains the following information for each match in the T20 World Cup:
* Date of the match
* Name of the match

## Acknowledgements:
I would like to acknowledge the T20 World Cup website (https://www.t20worldcup.com) for providing the data used in this project, as well as the developers of the Beautiful Soup package for making web scraping in Python easier and more accessible.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of web scraping and the versatility of the Beautiful Soup package for extracting data from websites. By collecting data on the T20 World Cup, we can gain insights into team performance, player statistics, and match schedules, and use this information to make more informed decisions in the future.
